You will find a green button on the top right corner of the screen that says download or clone then unzip them into a folder then open the **index.html** file in a browser and voi-la the game starts.

- **Run**
 Once you open the game, it starts by showing the player and the Gems are scattered over the game screen. Enemies move across the paved area in random speed. 

- **Play**
You should use the arrow keys to move your Player to reach the **water blocks**
trying to avoid the moving bugs (Enemies). Collect as many Gems as you can to increase your score. Once you reached the water blocks you move to the next level of the game.
